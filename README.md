# Netflix Analysis

Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of TV shows, movies, animes, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices.

## Project
In this project, we'll be exploring a [dataset available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) containing the information of TV Shows and Movies available on US Netflix.

We'll be using data visualizations to answer some questions:
1. How is the catalogue distribution in Movies and TV Shows?
2. How many Movies and TV Shows have been added to the Netflix catalogue each year?
3. Which countries have made the most Movies and TV Shows?
4. Is there a month/season of the year in which there are more additions to the catalogue?
5. How is the catalogue distribution in terms of TV Rating?
6. What are the most popular Netflix actors/actresses?
8. What are the most popular Movies/TV Shows genres?
9. What are the most common words on titles of Movies and TV Shows?

In order to answer these questions, the following steps had to be followed:
- Load and check the dataset;
- Data Cleaning;
- Create the Visualizations
